#devtest1 Get cryptocurrencies info


Basic code which gets info about cryptocurrencies from coinbase API using Node js. 
It was made to run once, not real-time refresh response. Jest was used to test functions, but I think the use can be improved. It's my first use of Jest. 
I was going to create a basic UI using Vue.js, but I had not much time to learn it. My front-end experience is not much, but I can learn to use the tools while developing a project. Actually, I did all the frontend of my work of conclusion of the graduation learning react js and developing.

The code uses the following libraries:

Jest
Axios

Some other libraries were just installed:

Express
Vue
Json
Vue-fusioncharts
