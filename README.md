# First aplication

Basic code which gets info about cryptocurrencies from coinbase api using Node js. It was made to run once, not real time refresh response.
Jest was use to test function, the use could be improved tought. Its my first use of Jest.
I would create a basic UI using Vue.js, but I haven't much time to learn it.

The code uses the following libraries:

* Jest
* Axios
